# Questions

This README scrapes documentation from the individual questions to
provide a quick reference (alternative to surfing all the codes) when
building new tests and domains. Information in individual question
files contained in this directory where the lines begin exactly as
follows: 

##q

will be collected and placed below. The script
scrape\_question\_metadata.sh simply applies a strict regex for
getting these and goes through the files in the order specified. 

The scraped info appears below.
